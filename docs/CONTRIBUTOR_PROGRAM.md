# tscircuit Contributor Program

The tscircuit contributor program sponsors between $5-$400/mo based
on contributions and impact. You can see all the contributions for
this week and past weeks with their AI-scored impact on our
[contribution tracker](https://github.com/tscircuit/contribution-tracker)

To be eligible for the program, you have to have at least 4 contributions
to tscircuit and be in the [discord](https://tscircuit.com/join)

Generally to reach the maximum sponsorship you'll need to have
more than 5 major contributions (equivalent to ~12 minor contributions)
every week and participate in the community on [discord](https://tscircuit.com/join).
You also have to be a consistent contributor to hit the max amount, so
you have to meet the criteria for more than a month.

Eventually the sponsorship amount will be tuned by AI, but for now
it's a bit manual. Please be patient, processing times can be as
quick as a day or as slow as 2 weeks. In addition, Github may need
some time to actually pay out.

tscircuit sponsorships are intended to reward people who actively contribute
to open-source in projects we use or in tscircuit itself. We reserve the right
to cancel a sponsorship for any conduct or remove someone from the program.

tscircuit has a limited budget, and the terms of the contributor program may
change based on participation and available budget.
