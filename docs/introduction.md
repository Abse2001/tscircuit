# Introduction to tscircuit

This is a placeholder introduction to tscircuit. Sorry!

Try doing `npm install -g tscircuit` then running `tsci dev` inside a directory, that'll
bootstrap the directory with files you can edit to explore.

Also the [two minute introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9m-bfswEv2k) could be
helpful!

Give this repo a star to show that someone is looking at this stuff!
