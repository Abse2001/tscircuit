# How to Publish

This is a placeholder article for how to publish to tscircuit.

That being said, it's not tooo complicated. If you have a package that
was bootstrapped with `tsci init` or `tsci dev`, you should be able to
just run `tsci publish`

The registry only really allows you to create packages for your Github
username, so try to name your package `@username/my-whatever`

Also you'll need to run `tsci auth` in order to publish. It's just a github
login.

Good luck! Star this repo to show me someone is looking at this if you want
more fleshed out guides!
